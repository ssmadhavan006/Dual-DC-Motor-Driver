## ðŸ“¦ Components

> Refer to [`components.text`](components.text) for detailed specs.

- **Arduino Uno/Nano** â€“ microcontroller to process control logic
- **L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver** â€“ allows bi-directional control of 2 motors
- **2x DC Motors** â€“ standard geared motors
- **Power Supply** â€“ 9V battery / DC adapter
- **Jumper Wires** â€“ for all connections
- **Breadboard** (optional) â€“ for rapid prototyping

## ðŸ§  How It Works

The L298N receives logic signals from Arduino digital pins to control each motorâ€™s direction. By setting pairs of input pins (IN1/IN2, IN3/IN4) HIGH/LOW, you control direction; setting both LOW stops the motor.
